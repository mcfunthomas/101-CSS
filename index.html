            You may relax and focus on the design of this site. So far, the
            <span class="text-highlight--blue">
              best experience has been achieved on laptops and desktops
            </span>
            where you can experience a "glued" background and hovering and
            clicking effects on the menu bar items as well as the
            <span class="contact-in-text"> CONTACT US</span> button. ENJOY!
          </p>
          <p class="why2">
            The below text section serves one purpose ONLY: for the user to see
            how the "glued" background image of the rocket above looks like
            while scrolling up and down. Again, on desktops and laptops only. I
            hope to improve the user experience with my next project.

            Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive
            domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that
            has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a
            streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will
            have multiple touchpoints for offshoring. Capitalize on low hanging
            fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test.
            Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from
            DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will
            close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.

            Podcasting operational change management inside of workflows to
            establish a framework. Taking seamless key performance indicators
            offline to maximise the long tail. Keeping your eye on the ball
            while performing a deep dive on the start-up mentality to derive
            convergence on cross-platform integration. Collaboratively
            administrate empowered markets via plug-and-play networks.
            Dynamically procrastinate B2C users after installed base benefits.
            Dramatically visualize customer directed convergence without
            revolutionary ROI.
          </p>
          <p class="waste-lateral">
            Efficiently unleash cross-media information without cross-media
            value. Quickly maximize timely deliverables for real-time schemas.
            Dramatically maintain clicks-and-mortar solutions without functional
            solutions. Completely synergize resource taxing relationships via
            premier niche markets. Professionally cultivate one-to-one customer
            service with robust ideas. Dynamically innovate resource-leveling
            customer service for state of the art customer service. Objectively
            innovate empowered manufactured products whereas parallel platforms.
            Holisticly predominate extensible testing procedures for reliable
            supply chains. Dramatically engage top-line web services vis-a-vis
            cutting-edge deliverables.

            This project may expand in the next assignment... unless I change my
            mind and build something more interesting. Wish me good luck and
            great imagination. Thank you!
